# Star Wars Heroes Explorer

This project is a test task for a React Developer. The main goal is to create a web application for viewing Star Wars heroes, their movies, and spaceships. The application not only allows users to see a list of heroes but also provides detailed information about each hero in a graph format using React Flow.

## 🚀 Functionality

### Star Wars Heroes List

- Using the [sw-api.starnavi.io API](https://sw-api.starnavi.io/), the application displays a list of Star Wars heroes.
- Pagination or infinite scroll is implemented for easy navigation through the list

### Hero Details

- When clicking on a hero, a graph is displayed where:
  -- The main node is the selected hero.
  -- Connections lead from the hero to the movies they appear in.
  -- Connections from each movie lead to the spaceships that the hero traveled on.

### Technologies Used

- **React.js:** for creating the application's interface.
- **React Flow:** for visualizing data in a graph format.
- **TypeScrip:** to ensure code reliability and clarity.
- **Tailwind CSS:** for styling the interface with responsive support.
